### Sequence diagram for accessing the single-page version of the notes app through https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the css file
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the JavaScript file
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "HTML is easy", "date": "2023-1-1" }, ... ]
    deactivate server
```

> In this case, the diagram is similar to accessing the norma version of the webpage. The client makes a request to the exampleapp/spa adress, which
> prompts the loading of the css, js, and raw data of the notes. The differences will start to show when the users makes the post request in the next exercise
